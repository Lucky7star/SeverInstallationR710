First there is really nothing in this for the larger commercial community. Dell wants to sell new servers because they do.</H3>
And nothing in it RedHat IBM now (and really you can tell its has changed the culture from back in the day of the first Secure SeaWolf  7.1 server. It was a breaking point in time when we were sure to run out of ip address... Then also too the architecture was moving from 32 to 64 and speeds and memory requirements were like moving from at an amazing pace.... From punch cards to pocket supercomputers in a blink of an eye but thinking back from 1972 to now... But a good place for me.
In any event I do like the Dell 7.10 working RedHat IBM in providing a subscription code.. Expensive but doable. 
The SBC Rpi4 captured my interest utilizing its speed and power sipping specs are appealing… The Rpi4 sporting the ARMv8 64 Cortex 72 is bit of a Ferrari in miniature, working in tandem with the 7.10 you have a considerable HPC, 
Getting them working together and certified maybe a bridge too far. But the first order of business is to get the 7.10 in state of certifiable conditions. I will add and edit this Read as necessary and welcome ideas and comments. 
The first steps are to follow the example of Ubuntu who has provided much of code the necessary in meetimg this goal. 
Also this goal would not be possible with the fore thought of Dell Inc. in the very important information provided by their Service tag and inventory support team,
kinda like the Toyota of the computer world. Toyota ranks #1 in consumer satisfaction, is not rated such simply because they’re egalitarians, but rather understand keeping their older models in high resell conditions adds considerable value to their companies’ value and bottom line.
